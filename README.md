# ðŸŽ® Random Number Guessing Game

A simple terminal-based number guessing game written in Python. The player is prompted to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and a user-defined maximum value. The game keeps track of how many attempts it takes to guess the correct number.

## ðŸš€ How It Works

1. The player is prompted to enter a **maximum value** (e.g., 10, 50, 100).
2. The program generates a **random number between 1 and that max value**.
3. The player keeps guessing until they get the correct number.
4. After each guess, the program tells the player if their guess is **too high** or **too low**.
5. When the number is guessed correctly, the total number of **tries** is displayed.
6. The player is then given the option to **restart** the game or quit.
